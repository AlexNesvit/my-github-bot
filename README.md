## This updated script generates a unique commit for each day by first clearing the data.txt file. It then creates between 0 to 22 random commits for each day 😜, beginning from 1 to unlimits (365 par example) days ago and counting back to the present. Once all commits are created, they're pushed to the remote repository. It's essential to run this script within a Git repository and ensure Git is set up correctly for commit and push operations. The script's flexibility allows for adjusting the number of days to suit your needs 😅.
